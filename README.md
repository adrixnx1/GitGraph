### Author: Adriana Barcenas  

This repository is for my Git Assignment for CSCI 3323.  
It demonstrates the creation of multiple branches, merges, resolving a merge conflict,  
and producing a commit graph similar to the one provided in the assignment.

Included:
- README.md
- STEPS.md
- meme image
- notes.md (a simple markdown file updated throughout the commits)
